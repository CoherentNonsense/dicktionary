# Dicktionary
A word definition game.

## How to play
Every game is made up of 5 rounds. At the start of a round, a word or definition of a word is shown. Players will either need to write a definition or word depending on what is shown. After all players have done so, all the answers are shown with the real one hidden in them. Players try guessing the real answer getting points either by getting the right answer or tricking other players into clicking your answer.

### words
The words right now are just a bunch of random words I found on a random word generator. There aren't enough yet so you can only play about one round before it starts feeling repetetive.
